V 1.0:
	Questions:
		•	Do we need make just "Process" class, or we need "ConnectDatabaseToPlatform", "FillTableUpperFields" and .....?
			- if we have just "Process", what about the Logic diffrence between each processes?
			- if we need "ConnectDatabaseToPlatform", "FillTableUpperFields" and ..., then We need write new class and recompile for new processes.
			
		•	Do we need "System Condition"? if yes, how we can manage them? There can be a lot of conditions like: (X >10 or CheckFileExist() and .....)
		
		•	Is Condition a special type of Process?
		
		
		
		
		Note:
			condition: "val && (x==8 || temp<=27)"
